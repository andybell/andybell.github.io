Don't place money on the bike. It is a long story but here is the cliffnotes.  As I was cruising through yosemite, my cassette (back gears for all the non bikers) was not spinning freely. After much confusion/frustration, I noticed that one of the bolts connecting the rack to the frame was rubbing on the cassette. Further inspection revealed that the head of the bolt had sheared off which allowed the bolt to uncontrollably tighten. By cross threading the broken bolt with a nut I was able to tighten it enough to make it to the next town where I was able to get the bolt replaced.
